Some of them are young and newly forming, others are as old as the galaxy itself. In these cards we will briefly explore the wonder that is the life cycle of a star.</p>

                     <p class="card-text">We start our journey in a stellar nursery. A chaotic mess consisting of gaseous clouds spanning multiple light years churning together. As gravity takes hold of the chaos, the clouds begin to collapse inward. Pressure and temperature drastically increase in the densest parts of the clouds. When the pressure and density reach a critical threshold a stellar miracle of life occurs. Nuclear fusion is achieved and a star is born. There are different forms of nebulae with different colors and compositions. The reasons for the glow vary for radiation to being lit by nearby bright stars. However these are not to be confused with supernova remnant nebula as these are not typically star forming regions.</p>

                     <p class="card-text">All good things must come to an end and here we find the supernova. Stars are primarily made of hydrogen which is the fuel for their nuclear fusion cores. Over the millennia the hydrogen is slowly converted to helium. Helium requires hotter temperatures to fuse than hydrogen. When the hydrogen runs out, the star undergoes a transformation as it begins to fuse helium. For some massive stars this forces them down a dangerous path that results in a first class ticket to a supernova. The star will continue to fuse heavier and heavier elements as the previous fuel runs out. For smaller stars the higher demand of energy to fuse heavy elements will cause it to expand and eventually lose its outer atmosphere. For the larger stars that chain reaction continues until gravity can no longer contain the nuclear fire. This of course results in the rapid expansion and explosion of the star.</p>

                     <p class="card-text">One of the potential outcomes from the death of a star is a white dwarf. The hottest and densest portion left behind to glow as a remnant to its previous glory. The core was the first part of the star to form and after millions to billions of years of fusion, it will be the only part left slowly simmering as fusion comes to an end. White dwarfs are composed of oxygen and carbon. Larger stars form neutron stars when they die. Neutron stars are unique in that they are composed of only neutrons.</p>

                     <p class="card-text">Regardless of the method in which a star dies it always results in a large portion of its mass being dispersed back into the galaxy. The matter it returns is a product of its billions of years of fusion. It has been enriched with heavier elements that which it began. This is analogous to the old adage of leaving a place better than you found it. Given enough time this process yields the heavy elements in quantity high enough to support our complex biological chemistry. So in a way we can thank the star lifecycle for everything that we know and love today.</p>
